DQL (Data Query Language) : DQL is use to read or retrieve the data from the database.

We have four sub-statements:

1. select
2. projection
3. selection
4. join


SELECT:- It is use to retrieve the data from the table and display it.

syntax: SELECT * /[DISTINCT]COLNAME/EXPRESSION[ALIAS];
 FROM table_name

    '*' :- It is use to select all the column present in the table.

    Order of execution: 1: FROM
                    2: SELECT

PROJECTION:- It is a process of retrieving the data by selecting only column is knows as projection.
syntax: SELECT COLNAME from table_name;

    DISTINCT:- It is use to remove the duplicate or repeated value from the result table.
        i>  Distinct claues has to be used as the first argument to select claues.
        ii> We can use multiple column as an argument to Distinct claues, it will remove the combination of columns in which the records are duplicated.

    EXPRESSION:- Any statement which give us some result is called EXPRESSION. It is an combination of operand and operator.

    ALIAS:- It is use to give an alternative name to a column or an EXPRESSION.
            We can give alias in two ways:- 1st-> using 'as' keyword.
                                            2nd-> without using 'as' keyword.      
            In order to give space between multiple words we are using two thinghs, 1st: '_' and 2nd: "".
